    <h3>Reflection</h3>
   <p>Pairing is awesome! Overall, my first GPS went very well.  I learned a lot from both my facilitator and my pairing partner.  Working things out in a pair really helps reinforce the concepts you've learned.  It allows you to (a) think out loud as you approach problems and have your partner validate these ideas and (b) see things from a perspective you may never have realized by having a different brain solving the problem alongside with you.  Switching off driving and navigating can be challenging, but is a good habit to develop since it forces you to work with another developer's code, which is something that will happen constantly in the real world.  I don't particularly care for wireframing in flockdraw, and stypi leaves something to be desired since it can't link to external style sheets.  That being said, they are probably the best options for this type of remote collaboration for now.  Fortunately, I had an awesome partner who communicated very clearly throughout the project, and together we had a good time learning about CSS positioning.</p>
