			<h5>pairing & feedbackination</h5>
		</br></br>

		<p>Pair programming is central to the student experience at DBC.  I must admit, I was a bit hesitant to begin my pairing adventures at first.  When you are cast into a virtual "classroom" with 60 or so other students of varying background and ability, pairing with a stranger can be a bit intimidating.  Would I embarass myself in front of someone with a Master's degree in CS? Or will I be miles ahead of my peer pair and feel held back?  It's impossible to know before you give it a shot, but you can easily deceive yourself into believing you will inevetiably be mismatched.</p><br>
		<p>Before I paired for the first time, I watched a fireside chat with Shereef.  He answered what I imagine is a frequently asked question -- in so many words, "Since DBC students have a pretty broad spectrum of skill and experience with coding upon enrolling, how can peer pairs be succesffuly?"  His answer was reassuring -- again I am parphrasing, but the gist was 'it's like we are all walking from San Fransisco to Seattle.  Some of us may feel we are starting from scratch, some people have a ten step head start, others may have a hundred step head start.  But we all have a long way to go, and we're going to get there together.'</p><br>
		<p>My pairing experience thus far has been as advertised. I honestly have yet to be paired with someone who had my same level of coding expertise, but this has not hindered the experience.  I've been on both sides of that coin -- seeking guidance from someone who far outmatched by skills, and helping another who was struggling with the curriculum.  In both cases, my comfort level with the topic at hand was reinforced.  We've solved every challenge thus far, some in two minutes, others in two hours, but successfully all the same.</p><br>
		<p>Of course feedback is vital to this process.  I love getting feedback, and have to say thus far I've received some great insight into my cultural and technical strengths and weaknesses.  Overall, it seems my peers perceive me largely the way I'd like to be, but constructive criticism has been present and welcome.  The most valuable piece I've received yet was "ask yourself: 'what is the simplest way to solve this problem?'  And the simplest way isn't always the easiest."  Since receiving this comment, I have slowed down my thought process at times in an attempt to reevaluate the problem at hand and see it with fresh eyes, or sniff out inefficiencies when refactoring, rather than putting stopgaps in place to simply get things running.</p><br>
		<p>Writing feedback is equally enlightening.  Honestly, the most challenging aspect of pairing for me is feedback.  I think this will be easier once we gather in person for Phase 1 onsite, but for the time being, it can be difficult to make critical comments "kind."  Without body language or inflection, feedback can feel impersonal, and it can be difficult to properly convey the tone you wish to strike without leaving things open for unintended interpretation.</p>
