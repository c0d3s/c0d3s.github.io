			<h5>evaluating websites</h5>
		</br>
			<p>[Groupon](http://www.groupon.com)<br>

 One of the few sites I check weekly is groupon.  Despite receiving email updates, I still find browsing the site pleasureable.  Upon reaching the site, your eyes are drawn to the "Recommended for You" section, a feature that recommends deals (I gather) based upon your purchase and search history.  Atop the page sits a blinking cursor situated within a friendly, familiar searchbar, invitiing you to search not only keywords but locations.  These are clearly important areas to pay attention to.  Visually, the site is inviting, selectively vibrant, friendly, organized, and well-branded (the lime-green logo goes a long way toward achiving this aim).  Functionally, Groupon is engaging, enjoyable, efficient, balanced, and streamlined.  The site is extremely easy to browse through; so easy, in fact, that I never spend much time on.  I am usually able to find what I am looking for, or (just as valuable) discover that what I am lookinf for does not exist within a few minutes.  I've purchased from this site numerous times because it is so organized and streamlined.<br><br>

 [Big Blue View](http://www.bigblueview.com)<br>

 I am a big NY (football) Giants fan -- even before they won two superbowls in the last decade.  That being said, I check bigblueview daily (unless the Giants fail to make the playoffs, in which case my routine dips noticeably from late December through early March.  In any case, bigblueview is a personal favorite.  When you visit the site, you will find a nice graphical layout of top stories.  Unfortunately, the ridiculous amount of ads on the page is rather distracting.  Still, the day's top story will immediately grab your attention, as the image representing it is roughly four times the size of the rest of the daily mix.  Another four stories run adjacent to it to the right, the combination of which will tell you all you need to know for the day.  Below the top stories is the twitter feed, followed by the obligitory comments section (always a good read -- NY sports fans never fail to entertain). The visual layout of the site is bold, busy, cluttered, messy, a bit spastic, and yet conventional.  Again, a lot of this is due to the way ads decorate every available area of the site.  Functionally, the site is informative, up-to-date, effective (a lot of info), modern, and witty.  Information is quite is to find, since the search function on the site is very well-implemented and news stories are easily sorted by players and time-frame.  My favorite thing about this site is its "story stream" feature, which uses tags to automatically link stories together in a sort-of time line.  Is the player you were looking for benched this week?  You can quickly find past stories about his public apology, league-sanctioned fines and suspension, and superfluous touchdown celebration video (in reverse-chronological order) by means of this feature.  This is a site I can spend hours on, though after a certain point and feel informed about our playoff hopes (which hasn't been particularly positive in recent years).  <br><br>

 [Craigslist](http://www.craigslist.org)<br>
 I know, real original.  But there are few sites I spend as much time on as craigslist.  To say the visual appearance of this site is dated doesn't do it justice -- it's like taking a time machine back to 1996 (albeit an alternate version of 1996 where people have cell phones with cameras and text messaging capabilities).  Yes, from a visual standpoint the site is outdated, spartan and downright chincy; however, it is well-balanced and organized.  Functionally, the site is efficient, orderly, straight-forward, user-friendly, and utilitarian.  While your eyes may not be immediately directed to any particular area upon entering the site, it's easy to find what you're looking for since absolutely everything is posted under specific categories, which are a breeze to navigate through.  While the design of this site may be lacking, functionally it is still very relevant.</p>
