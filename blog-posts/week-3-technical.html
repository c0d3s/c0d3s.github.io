<h6>What is JavaScript?</h6></br>

Javascript is a computer language that runs inside your browser.  It can do cool things that make a page interactive.  JavaScript can be used to create dynamic user interfaces, perform calculations, take input from a user, and much more.  In fact, some of the most widely used web apps, like Gmail and Google Maps, are built using JavaScript.<br><br>

<h6>Why was JavaScript created?</h6><br>

JavaScript was developed in the mid 90's for Netscape Navigator, which at the time dominated the world wide web.  It was developed in an effort to make the web more dynamic at a time in history when the internet was made up of static, and, well, boring pages.<br><br>

<h6>Why call it JavaScript?  Is it the same thing as Java?</h6><br>

First thing's first: JavaScript is <em> not </em> Java.  In fact, during development JavaScript was originally called Mocha, then LiveScript.  The name JavaScript was born out of litle more than a marketing ploy.  At the time Sun Microsystem's Java, a completely separate programming language of the compiled variety, was gaining in popularity, so the creators of Mocha/LiveScript used the name "JavaScript" under license from Sun.  The new language was positioned as a companion, "little brother" language to Java, though the two languages have many differences between them. <br><br>

<h6>What made JavaScript so popular early on?</h6><br>

Netscape's new language was officially standardized  by ECMA (the official internationally body for standardizing such things) in mid 1997.  But the language was already gaining steam by then.  Netscape included it in their browser in late 1996.  Microsoft, Netscape's only real competitor in the then nascent browser marketplace, sought to compete with Netscape's new way way of making the web dynamic and released a stringingly similar copy cat language (called "JScript" in order to avoid a lawsuit) in their Internet Explorer browser.  The "browser wars" got nasty, with major anti-competitive suits soon to follow ( a topic for another blog, perhaps) but Microsoft's JScript was for the most part compatible with JavaScript. Now that the two the top browsers (which combined at the time to a hair shy of 100% market share) had support for JavaScript, the language became ubiquitous. <br><br>

<h6>Okay, but that was 20 years ago.  Why is it used today?</h6><br>

The mid-2000s gave rise to "the web 2.0," a new age in how users interact with the world wide web.  This trend is marked by increased interactivity across the web, and a development cycle that puts the user experience as the top priority.  It's not difficult to see how websites today look and behave radically different from ones from even ten years ago.  JavaScript had a major part it this.  Keep in mind, by the time the web 2.0 revolution began, JavaScript was already firmly entrenched in the programming community and built in to practically every browsing interface available.  A few shrewd programmers began working on techniques that utilized JavaScript (like AJAX) to make the experience more seamless.  Still, others pushed the boundaries of what JavaScript could already do by way of libraries -- basically pre-written code -- for use in these techniques.  JQuery, the most popular library, is currently in use by more than 60% of the top 10,000 websites!  A recent technology called node.js even allows JavaScript to run on the server-side rather than in a browser, further pushing the envelope.  Even today JavaScript continues to evolve.<br>
