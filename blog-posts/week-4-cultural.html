			<h5>big problem facing the tech industry</h5>
		</br></br>
			<p>
We live in an age where it can seem like our real life is little more than playing the part of the digital versions of ourselves we've created.  This isn't an attack on social networking -- there are far more important (and scary) things than your vacation photos that live all over the place on some internet connected hard disks.  Credit cards, social security numbers, and bank accounts are a of the key pieces of information that essentially serve as our identity.
<br><br>
Recent events will tell you that information security is the single biggest issue facing the technology industry today.  The stakes have never been higher.  When the Playstation Network gets hacked, 12 million credit cards suddenly become jeopardized.  When Target's point of sale terminals become infected with malware, 40 million accounts are in immediate danger.  Identity theft on a personal level is occurring at an unprecedented level.  Most frightning of all, our national infrustructure is always at risk -- everything from traffic lights to nuclear power plants stand to be tampered with.  Fortunately, even while international coporate cyber-espionage has been confirmed, the United States has thus far avoided a catastrophic attack on the nation's power grid, but the threat looms.  How do we fight these threats?
<br><br>
Education and awareness, at all levels, will be key in keeping our digital world secure.  While nearly everyone in the developed world interacts with highly-advanced technology on a daily basis, very few by comparison know what's going on behind the scenes.  And this is a dangerous trend.  It's bigger than someone grabbing shared files from your computer while connected to an unsecured wifi network.  It's bigger than a few people's bank accounts becomming compromised.
<br><br>
Awareness needs to start early.  We as a culture should be educating from an early age.  I don't mean best practices like disabling the Java plug-in in your browser, I mean the nuts and bolts of how computers talk to each other.  Not only does this arm the average youth to be able to protect his/her own personal identity, but it prepares them for the possibility of learning what it takes to protect our livlihood on a much grander scale. 
<br><br>
Advanced higher education is without a doubt vital to fighting against the big threats that face us.  In order to prepare our cyber-warriors to keep our infrastructure secure, we have to be proactive.  A major concern facing agencies like the NSA currently is a lack of top-eschalon talent.  This is largely because, as in other industries, the private sector pays better.  Why not institue scholarship programs where potential candidates who meet stringent qualifications and display exceptional aptitude receive full scholarships to top programs specifically designed for national security requirements in exchange for serving in a federal position upon graduation?  Why not begin educating schoolkids on networking and information security early on, giving them an opportunity to develop the skills and passion necessary for success at the top levels? Sure, these aren't strictly "cheap" solutions for a government saddled with 14 figures of debt, but compared to the level of defense spending, wouldn't these educational programs provide a significant return on protecting our most vital, and potentially vulnerable assets?
