			<p>Shereef's fireside chat reiterated some key focal points that initial drew me to DBC in the first place.  Three adjectives typical of DBC students were mentioned in the first five minutes of the video that particularly stood out:  Intellect, Attitude, and Passion.<br><br>

<em>Intellect</em><br>
The goal of DBC isn't so much to teach skills as it is to teach principles, senses, and an overall mindset for how things work.  It's clear that Rails is simply the vehicle used to hone these attributes.  The goal here isn't to learn the nuts and bolts of web development (though that will certainly be a requirement).  It's to be able to think like an engineer in order to solve problems effectively, and (equally important) be able to communicate these ideas with a team.<br><br>

<em>Attitude</em><br>
When you elect to spend 14 hours a day in a room full of strangers for nine weeks, you can bet attitude will be important.  Social empathy is pivotal to success not only within the DBC environment, but within any development environment you will find (especially the ones you'll be paid in). We'll have to learn to give and receive critical feedback, without offending or being offended.  We'll learn how to work with people at various points in their journey to becomming a web developer, and how to effectively communicate when there is a gap in knowledge.  We'll learn to take the lead when we know what needs to be done, while being comfortable enough to ask for guidance or feedback when stumbled. Humility and confidence are not mutually exclusive, and nobody likes someone who doesn't play well with others.<br><br>

<em>Passion</em><br>
Of course.  Why else would we quit our day jobs, put our social lives on hold, and wager twelve grand if we weren't passionate?  Even more than being motivated or committed to boldly tackle the road ahead, passion entails being driven to continuous learn and improve oneself while also contributing to the development community and helping others throughout their own journeys.
