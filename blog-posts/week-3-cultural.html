			<h5>personal thinking styles and the growth mindset</h5>
		</br></br>
			<p>
I am a concrete random thinker.  According to Anthony Gregorc's model, this means I am a risk-taking experimenter who relies upon his intuation to solve problems.  I thrive in competitive environments where I can be left to my own devices and use trial-and-error to arrrive at a solution to a problem.  Formalities, routines, and detailed record keeping are my weaknesses.  I think anyone who knows me well enough would agree with the result of this quiz.</br></br>

It should be noted that the abstract sequential learning style was a close second for me.  I am, in line with this learning profile, someone who loves the world of theory and abstract thought.  These two seemingly condratictory learning styles acutally lend themselves very nicely to each other and my overall mindset.  I learn most effictively when I have the chance to research theory and develop a sound understanding of an abstract concept first and then experiment with what I have found in order to apply these ideas to the real world.  Whenever I approach a new challenge with DBC, I give myself ample time to research the concepts outlined, then buckle down and try things out -- the experimentation reinforces the theory.</br></br>

My biggest challenges admittedly relate to time management.  I am highly curious and like to think in unconventional ways to solve problems.  The downside of all this is that I can struggle to meet deadlines are even stay focused on the task at hand.  If something sparks my interest, I will pour my energy into it seeking to absorb as much knowledge on the topic of choice as possible.  Of course, the thing I'm pouring my time, energy, and resources into isn't always the task at hand.</br></br>

I'm learning just how valuable pair programming (after performing a bit of personal research) can be to me.  It provides an avenue for experimentation where I will often have a different idea about how to solve a problem than my partner.  Pairing also keeps me on track, rather than spinning off in a million different directions. 

Perhaps most importantly, pairing is the best way for me to continue to hone a growth mindset.  While I'd love to think of myself as 100% in the growth mindset, I am still fixed in a few aspects.  A big part of this is fear of failure -- while I know this shouldn't hold me back and that every experience is a learning opportunity, I will admit this is an area of personal development I am working on.  Pairing helps in this aim by forcing me to think on my feet in front of others and provide ideas that may or may not work.  Even when these ideas do not produce a  viable solution, the "thinking out loud" method and sharking ideas with a partner speeds up the process.  And every time I pair, I feel inspired and motivated by my peers, which is a key facet of the growth mindset.
