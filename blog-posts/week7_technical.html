			<h5>ruby variable scope</h5>
			</br></br>
			<p>Ruby makes provisions for four dinstinct types of variables: local, instance, class, and global.  As their names may imply, the differences between these types lie in their scope, or accessibility.  Each aforementioned variable type takes a step up in scope from the previous one.  We begin with the humble local variable.</p><br>
			<p><b>Local variables</b> are only accessible within the code in which they are defined.  If a local variable is declared within a method, it will not be accessible outside said method.  The same goes for loops, blocks, etc.  Local variables are easily recognized; convention states they only contain lower case letters, numbers, and underscores.</p><br>
			<p><b>Instance variables</b> are accessible everywhere in a specific instance of an object.  They are typically declared in the #initialize method of a class.  This all means that if we define an instance variable in #initialize and we want to use this variable in another method like #double_number, we can access the same variable.  If the instance variable was instead a local variable, our #double_number method would not be able to see the variable.  Keep in mind, though, that if we create a separate instance of a class, the variable will not be the same, as it is local to a specific instance.  Instance variables are recognizable by the fact that they always contain the @ symbol as it's first character.</p><br>
			<p><b>Class variables</b> expand on the scope of instance variables by making the variable visible to <em>all</em> instances of a class.  This means that there is only one variable with one value that exists for every object that is instantiated from a class.  Remember that if you change the value of this variable in one instance of a class, the value will change in all other instances as well.  Class variables are recognized by being prefixed by two @@ symbols.</p><br>
			<p><b>Global variables</b> have the greatest scope -- they are accesible from <em>anywhere</em> in a Ruby program.  Declare a global variable in a block, method, class, instance, what have you, and your Ruby program will be able to make use of it in any other block, method, class, instance, what have you.  Global variables are prefixed with a $ and conventionally are comprised of all capital letters.</p><br>
