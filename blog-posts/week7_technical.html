			<h5>sql injection</h5>
			</br></br>
			<p>SQL injection is a common technique used by hackers to gain access to or otherwise manipulate information in a database.  A malicious user can inject SQL commands into an SQL statement via unchecked input on a web page, thereby compromising the security of the web application.  While SQL injection attacks are all-too-common, they are easily preventable.  But how do they work?</p><br>
			<p>Consider the design of a simple web app.  In our imaginary scenario, usernames and passwords are stored in a database, and upon visiting a website, a user is prompted to enter his/her user name and password in two separate fields.  The creator of this app has designed it to then take the input from these two fields and place it in the middle of an SQL statement.  A savvy hacker may easily exploit this vulnerability by placing their own language in these fields that is then injected into the existing SQL statement.</p><br>
			<p>The easiest way to avoid such exploitation is to simply check the input a user provides before it is placed into the SQL statement.  One may even decide to 'blacklist' certain words that used in SQL syntax to achieve this aim.  This, however, is not the best method to take, considering the syntax of SQL features words common to the English language and a lot of regularly-used punctuation, and we wouldn't want to unneccessarily prohibit a long list of words/characters to be used in usernames or passwords.</p><br>
			<p>The best way to prevent SQL injection is to parameterize the input.  When we do this, we effectively isolate the input, where it is treated like common data.  This way, the input provided by the user is never directly injected into the SQL statement, and anything the user types into input fields cannot be executed.</p><br>
			<p>There are of course other measures a developer can take to prevent exploitation.  An example of this would be encrypting the data stored within the database along with the input a user provides.  This way when an SQL statement parses through the encrypted input, the actual characters the user has typed in will never be executed.  That being said, parameterization is the most effective proven method.</p><br>
