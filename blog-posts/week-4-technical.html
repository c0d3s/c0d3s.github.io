			<h5>what the heck is Enumerable#group_by?</h5>
		</br></br>
			<p>
Perhaps we should start with "what the heck is Enumerable?" Well, Enumerable methods provide powerful ways to loop.  It's one of the reasons you hardly ever see for loops in Ruby.  In addition to simply iterating through code over and over again, Enumerable provides ways to search, alter, and organize your data.  As you may have guessed my focus today is on  Enumerable#groub_by, which falls under the "organize" category.
<br><br>
Enumerable#group_by will take your boring, disorganized array and return a pretty new hash.  Let's say you have an array of the numbers 1 through 10, but you want to separate the odd numbers from the even numbers.  Observe:
<br><br>
<div class="snippet">irb(main):001:0> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].group_by {|number| number % 2}<br>
=> {1=>[1, 3, 5, 7, 9], 0=>[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]}</div>
<br><br>
Fittingly, our group_by method grouped the even numbers into one array, and the odd numbers into another and stored this data in theform of a hash.  Our arrays are now values, the keys to which are enumerators (0 for the numbers where the expression number % 2 evaluates to 0, and 1 for those that evaluate to 1).  But the keys don't have to be numbers.  Let's get a little more sophisticated.
<br><br>
Say we have a list of names stored in an array in no particular order.  We would like to group these names together alphabetically.  Enter Enumerable#group_by.
<br><br>
<div class="snippet">irb(main):002:0> names = ["Harry", "Larry", "Barry", "Lidia", "Zeke", "Lisa", "Heidi", "Barbara"]<br>
=> ["Harry", "Larry", "Barry", "Lidia", "Zeke", "Lisa", "Heidi", "Barbara"]<br>
irb(main):003:0> names.group_by {|name| name[0]}<br>
=> {"H"=>["Harry", "Heidi"], "L"=>["Larry", "Lidia", "Lisa"], "B"=>["Barry", "Barbara"], "Z"=>["Zeke"]}</div>
<br><br>
In this instance, the keys to our hash are the first letters of each name.  We are able to specify this in the block of code (the bit just after the pipes) where we say name[0].  In this instance, name is the element we are working with, which happens to be a string.  We go to the [0] index -- aka the first letter -- and this becomes our key.  Enumerable#group_by is good for more than just alphabetic sorting.
<br><br>
Let's take that same list of names and group by the length of each name.
<br><br>
<div class="snippet">irb(main):004:0> names.group_by {|name| name.length}<br>
=> {5=>["Harry", "Larry", "Barry", "Lidia", "Heidi"], 4=>["Zeke", "Lisa"], 7=>["Barbara"]}</div>
<br><br>
Or maybe we just want to know which names are "long" or "short".  
<br><br>
<div class="snippet">irb(main):005:0>names.group_by { | name | name.length < 5}<br>
=> {false=>["Harry", "Larry", "Barry", "Lidia", "Heidi", "Barbara"], true=>["Zeke", "Lisa"]}</div>
<br><br>
Sure, five letters is an arbitrary number to separate long and short, but in this case our keys are boolean values -- "true" for names less than five characters long and "false" for those that are longer.
<br><br>
The possibilities are virtually endless.  Enumerable#group_by gives you a wide array (pun intended) of options for organizing your data.
