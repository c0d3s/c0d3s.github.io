			<h5>stereotype threat</h5>
		</br></br>

		<p>As a white male living in America, stereotype has not affected me as much as say...well, just about everybody else on the planet. That being said, I do find the concept of subconscious self-handicapping interesting.  The idea behind this is that when faced with a task that could lead to you reaffirming a certain stereotype, your attention is diverted towards avoiding the threat, which ultimately leads to poorer performance.</p><br>
		<p>I couldn't help but be reminded of growth versus fixed mindset when researching this topic.  Allowing one's own performance to be hindered due to fear of failure is the very definition of the fixed mindset.  Evolution is probably at least partly to blame for this phenominon -- we are wired to prioritize things we deem to be threats above all else.  But these are not life or death situations we are talking about.</p><br>
		<p>It seems when certain expectations are cast upon us, intentionally or unintentionally, performace largely correlates to the expected outcome.  I'm not sure I've ever experienced this for myself.</p><br>
		<p>For instance, when I was an adolescent, I was involved in just about any sport I could get into.  I was shorter than all my peers by a few inches to a foot or more.   I was scrawny (I didn't crack 100 pounds til halfway through high school).  And I wore thick glasses.  Also, I was one of the more studious kids in class, and really nice, and well, pretty much a nerd.  Yeah.   Imagine you are the most athletic person in class, and you have all your peers lined up in front of you.  You're picking teams for a friendly football match.  Guess who is getting picked last.</p><br>
		<p>But the fact that I faced the expectation that I would be useless in competition (when in reality I was pretty skilled athletically, despite my size), led me to take more risks in order to try to buck the convention.  Really, I had little to lose -- I was already picked last and faced the battle of competing against people much larger than I.  I would argue that the negative stereotype served as a motivator and actually enhanced my performance, whereas if I were expected to succeed, I likely would have been more afraid of not living up to expectations and not taken the risks necessary to effectively compete.</p><br>
		<p>Once again, from a personal standpoint, I have very little experience with the subject.  And the above example doesn't exactly serve as the type of academic research pinpointed in the study.  But I can say that low expectations has served more as a motivator and less as a self-fulfilling prophecy for me.</p></br>
