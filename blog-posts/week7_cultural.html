			<h5>values</h5>
		</br></br>
<p>"Select a value: 
Pick one or two values and write a couple of sentences about why they are important to you."<br><br>
<b>Creativity</b>: I believe creativity is a hallmark of achievement.  A creative person causes things to be.  He is a producer, not merely a consumer, and he thusly is making contributions to society.<br><br>
<b>Influence</b>: When I think of influence, I don't think of someone who manipulates others to get what they want.  An influential person constantly strives to lead and mentor when the time is right.  I feel the concept of influence is more important than leadership though, since an influencer encourages and motivates others to make positive changes regardless of the status of either party.<br><br>
<b>Ambition</b>: Ambitious people are always willing to improve, and to help others do the same.  It's not about accruing wealth or rising in social status; it is about making the situation for yourself and those around you better.  It means willingness to tackle greater challenge without fear of failure.  It is the courage to take risks and prove yourself in the face of adversity.  It is the ability to help others overcome complacency and do everything in their power to improve the world we live in.<br><br>

These are the values I try to live by</p><br>

<p>"Advice: 
What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on? Does it relate to your values?"<br><br>

Amongst my friends, I seem to be a go-to-guy for advice.  Perhaps because I am unbiased, but more likely because I have a track record of taking calculated risks in order to fulfill certain goals, while also being adaptable and ready to roll with the punches.</p><br>

<p>"Values and Stereotype threat: 
Values can be a powerful way to negate stereotype threat if you can bring them to mind when you are under a threat. For this part, consider:"<br><br>
<ul>
<li>"How do you feel when you think about your values?"</li>
	<ul><li>If I keep my values in the forefront of my mind, I can overcome any challenge at DBC.</li></ul>
<li>"Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?"</li>
	<ul><li>Absolutely.  Stereotype threats are external.  Values are internal.</li></ul>
<li>"Can you think of any mental or physical exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?"</li>
	<ul><li>Remember what's important to you.  Remember why you are here and where you want to be.  Drop every excuse and obstacle between your current place and your goal.  Add these obstacles in one by one, then use one of your core value to overcome it.</li></ul></ul></p>
